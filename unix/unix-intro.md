**Unix is very likely the most foundational skillset we can develop for bioinformatics** (and much more than bioinformatics). This is a set of 5 introductory tutorials to help us get from being completely new to Unix up to being great friends with it ðŸ™‚ 

<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />
# Why learn Unix?
*  it's the foundation for most of bioinformatics
*  enables the use of non-GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools
*  reproducibility
*  quickly perform operations on large files (without reading into memory)
*  automation of repetitive tasks (need to rename 1,000 files?)
*  enables use of higher-powered computers elsewhere (server/cloud)  

>**NOTE:** Maybe the most imporant thing to keep in mind while going through these pages is that this is all about <i>exposure</i>, not memorization or mastering anything. Don't worry about the details!
