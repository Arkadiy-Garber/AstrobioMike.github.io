# Some terminology 
Here are some terms that are often used interchangeably â€“ not because it's important to remember them or any differences (it's not for most of us), but just to have them laid out somewhere. 

| Term     | What it is          |
|:-------------:|------------------|
| **`shell`** | what we use to talk to the computer; anything where you are pointing and clicking with a mouse is a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**) shell; something with text only is a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (**CLI**) shell |  
| **`command line`** | a text-based environment capable of taking input and providing output |  
| **`Unix`** | a family of operating systems |  
| **`bash`** | the most common programming language used at a Unix command-line |
