# Welcome!

You have somehow found your way to Mike's Space. I am new here too, so at the moment there isn't much here yet. But in time I hope to make this site a useful resource for people who are working their way into bioinformatics. I will be structuring things in a way that I think would have been most helpful to me when I was starting out.  

At the heart of this philosophy is that it's okay to just take bits and pieces from different things without fully understanding the whole of where you're pulling from. For instance, you don't need to spend weeks on python tutorials (that are designed for people who want to become programmers) if you just need one quick script to manipulate a fasta file. I didn't really get that at first. I spent months on python and R tutorials. And I enjoyed them and felt like I was learning. But the problem was that virtually none of it directly translated into what I wanted (and needed) to do for my research. So while it was good for me and could only help in the long run, it was a lot of time spent *not* moving my research forward. And because there was no immediate application to my work, there was also no reinforcement of what I was learning anyway. So in hindsight I don't think that was a very efficient way to learn. I ultimately ended up learning most effectively by simply diving into my data and perpetually just figuring out the next thing I needed to do. This took me from *bash*, to python, to R pretty regularly – which can definitely be a bit of an intimidating whirlwind at times – but I was always working on *my* data and was still moving along my research (albeit painfully slowly on more than one occasion). 

This somewhat scattered way of learning allowed me to slowly expand my skillset in many directions at once, and most importantly it was always while developing skills that were by default directly applicable to my work. But I also realize that back then if someone said to me, "*Just use all these things you don't understand to do the things you don't know how to do and move on.*", I'd still be just as stuck – and left thinking that person was not very helpful. So the plan here is to provide tutorials that are targeted and easy to navigate, and blogs that highlight things I think were important in my earlier development, or are important in my ongoing development. 

For now if you'd like you can find out more about me and my plans for the site at the [About](/about/) page, or check out the beginning stages of [*bash* Central](/bash.html) for some baseline information of what exactly *bash* is at, or see what I'm working on first for the site in the [Things to look forward to...](/2017/09/11/coming-soon.html) post.
