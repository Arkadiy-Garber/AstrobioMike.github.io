You have somehow found your way to Happy Belly Bioinformatics. This is a new project and very much a work in progress, but in time I hope to make this site a useful resource for people who are just beginning to work their way into bioinformatics by structuring things in a way that I think would have been most helpful to me when I was starting out. Generally the plan here is not to provide all-encompassing information on any individual topic, but rather to help people more quickly acquire a baseline set of skills that can then be built upon further. 

For now you can find out more about me and what I've found to be the most effective way to beat the steep learning curve at the [about page]({{ site.url }}/about/). If you are new to working in a command-line environment, you should check out the [*bash* area](/bash/) for some baseline information and terminology (like what exactly "*bash*" is) and then run through the [*bash* basics](/bash/basics) walkthrough to get the fundamentals down. If you're looking to get your feet wet with R, then jump right in with the [R basics](/R/basics) walkthrough. And if you're intested in marker-genes, the [amplicon analysis section](/amplicon/) has some baseline information and terminology and you can walkthough an [example workflow](/amplicon/workflow_ex) of processing a tag dataset from scratch at the command lineand analyzing tag data with the

If you're just beginning to wade your way into this enticing ocean of bioinformatics, I hope you find some of the resources here helpful.
