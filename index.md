You have somehow found your way to Happy Belly Bioinformatics. I am new here too, so at the moment there isn't much here yet. But in time I hope to make this site a useful resource for people who are working their way into bioinformatics. I will be structuring things in a way that I think would have been most helpful to me when I was starting out. The main philosophy is that it's *okay* to learn just enough of something to be able to do what you need to do, and that you don't need to master everything you come across. For instance, we don't need to spend weeks on python tutorials (that are mostly designed for people who want to become programmers) if we just need to write one quick script to manipulate a file so you can run whatever tool you're trying to use and then move on to the next part of your research (and possibly not think about python again for months). Developing skills piece-wise as needed ended up being the best path forward for me, and still is.  

The plan here is not to provide all-encompassing information of any individual topic, but rather to help people more quickly acquire a baseline set of skills that can then be built upon further. I'll be posting tutorials and blogs that highlight things that were important in my earlier development, or are important in my ongoing development. For now you can find out more about me and what I've found to be the most effective way to beat the steep learning curve at the <a href="{{ site.url }}/about/">About</a> page; or check out the <a href="{{ site.url }}/bash/"><i>bash</i></a> area for some baseline information of what exactly <i>bash</i> is and run through the [basics]({{ site.url }}/bash/basics) walkthrough; or see what I'm working on first for the site in the ["Things to look forward to..."]({{ site.url }}/2017/09/28/coming-soon.html) post.

If you're just beginning to wade your way into the bioinformatics ocean, I hope you find some of the resources here helpful.
