**Familiarity with the Unix command-line is very likely the most foundational skillset we can develop for bioinformatics** (and for many computational arenas beyond bioinformatics). This is a set of 5 introductory tutorials to help us get from being completely new to Unix up to being great friends with it ðŸ™‚

# Some terminology 
Here are some terms that are often used interchangeably â€“ not because it's important to remember them or any differences (it's not for most of us), but just to have them laid out somewhere. 

| Term     | What it is          |
|:-------------:|------------------|
| **`command line`** | a text-based environment capable of taking input and providing output |  
| **`shell`** | what we use to talk to the computer; anything where we are pointing and clicking with a mouse is a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**) shell; something with text only is a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (**CLI**) shell |  
| **`Unix`** | a family of operating systems |  
| **`bash`** | the most common programming language used at a Unix command-line |

# Why learn the Unix shell?
*  enables the use of non-GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools
*  reproducibility
*  quickly perform operations on large files (without reading into memory)
*  automation of repetitive tasks (need to rename 1,000 files?)
*  enables use of higher-powered computers elsewhere (server/cloud)  
*  it's the foundation for most of bioinformatics

>**NOTE:** Maybe the most imporant thing to keep in mind while going through these pages is that this is all about <i>exposure</i>, not memorization or mastering anything. Don't worry about the details! Starting to build a foundation of fundamentals will allow us to figure out more details for specific things when we need to ðŸ™‚
