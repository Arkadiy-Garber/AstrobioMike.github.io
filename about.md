Hi there. My name's Mike. I use the tools of bioinformatics to explore microbial ecology and evolution in all kinds of different systems. I'm currently a PhD student at University of Southern California, and will soon be moving on to NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffet Field, CA as a [Space Biology postdoctoral fellow](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-alfred-p-sloan-foundation-award-fellowships-to-study-space-station-microbes) where my primary focus will be hunting for molecular evolution in microbes from the International Space Station.  
<br>
I am definitely the 'biology-to-bioinformatics' type of person. I had never even seen a terminal window until my second year of grad school. Over the past few years I've been in the thralls of the steep learning curve that so many of us face at first, and it wasn't until pretty recently that I became comfortable with the idea of refering to myself as a bioinformatician. And while I'm lightyears beyond where I started, I still consider myself an infant with regard to how much further I'd like to develop. But that's the thing. It's always relative. On this relative scale, if anyone is at an earlier stage than I currently am, I'd love to help out. That's who I hope this site becomes a resource for, bioinformatics beginners who want help getting through the steep, initial learning curve. But first, some disclaimers.

<center><h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3></center>
Right off the bat let's make it clear that I plan to cover topics here that I am certainly **not** an expert on, but rather of which I have a working understanding that allows me to do the work I do. For instance, I'm nowhere near fluent in any individual programming language, but I consistently hop between *bash*, R, and python depending on what I'm trying to do. Let's also make it clear there are a million ways to do basically anything, and I most often will probably not be doing things the most efficient way possible; not by choice of course, but because, again, I'm not an expert, and also when something works I usually move onto the next thing rather than optimizing what I can leave alone.

## Okay, so now that I've explained I'm not the best at any of this, why am I bothering you?
Utlimately, I am going to try to provide the sort of help I think would have helped me, and in a way I would have understood when I was just starting. At the heart of this philosophy is that it's okay to just take bits and pieces from different things without fully understanding the whole of where you're pulling from. For instance, you don't need to spend weeks on python tutorials (that are designed for people who want to become programmers) if you just need one quick script to manipulate a fasta file. I didn't really get that at first. 

I spent months on python and R tutorials. And I enjoyed them and felt like I was learning. But the problem was that virtually none of it directly translated into what I wanted (and needed) to do for my research. So while it was good for me and could only help in the long run, it was a lot of time spent *not* moving my research forward. And because there was no immediate application of these new skills to my work, there was also no reinforcement of what I was learning anyway, and therefore very little retention. 

In hindsight I don't think that was a very efficient way to learn. What I found to work most effectively for me was simply diving into my data and perpetually just figuring out the next thing I needed to do. This took me from *bash*, to python, to R pretty regularly â€“ which can definitely be a bit of an intimidating whirlwind at times â€“ but I was always working on *my* data and was still moving along my research (albeit painfully slowly on more than one occasion). This somewhat scattered way of learning allowed me to slowly expand my skillset in many directions at once â€“ and most importantly it was always while developing skills that were by default directly applicable to my work. 

Now I realize that back then if someone had simply said to me, "*Just use all these things you don't understand to do the things you don't know how to do and move on, it'll be great.*", I'd still be just as stuck â€“ and left thinking that that person was not really all that helpful. 

I want this site to help bridge that gap â€“ to help people to more quickly develop the baseline set of skills needed to do their work. After that, the sphere of capabilities can expand organically, without there being a technical bottleneck on the science being done.
