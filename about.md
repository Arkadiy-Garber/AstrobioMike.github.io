Hi there. My name's Mike. I use the tools of bioinformatics to explore microbial ecology and evolution in all kinds of different systems. I'm currently a PhD student at University of Southern California, and will soon be moving on to NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffet Field, CA as a [Space Biology postdoctoral fellow](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-alfred-p-sloan-foundation-award-fellowships-to-study-space-station-microbes) where my primary focus will be hunting for molecular evolution in microbes from the International Space Station.

I am definitely the 'biology-to-bioinformatics' type of person. I had never even seen a terminal window until my second year of grad school. Over the past few years I've been in the thralls of the steep learning curve that so many of us face at first, and it wasn't until pretty recently that I became comfortable with the idea of refering to myself as a bioinformatician. And while I'm lightyears beyond where I started, I still consider myself an infant with regard to how much further I'd like to develop. But that's the thing. It's always relative. On this relative scale, if anyone is at an earlier stage than I currently am, I'd love to help out.  That's what I hope this site becomes a resource for, bioinformatics beginners who want help getting through the steep, initial learning curve.

Right off the bat let's make it clear that I plan to cover topics here that I am certainly **not** an expert on, but rather of which I have a working understanding that allows me to do the work I do. For instance, I'm nowhere near fluent in any individual programming language, but I consistently hop between *bash*, R, and python depending on what I'm trying to do. Let's also make it clear there are a million ways to do basically anything, and I most often will probably not be doing things the most efficient way possible; not by choice of course, but because, again, I'm not an expert, and also when something works I usually move onto the next thing rather than optimizing what I can leave alone.

Utlimately, I am going to try to provide the sort of help I think would have helped me, and in a way I would have understood when I was just starting. If you're just beginning to wade your way into the bioinformatics world, I hope you find some of the resources here helpful.
