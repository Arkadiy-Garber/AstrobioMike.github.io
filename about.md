Hi there. My name's Mike. I use the tools of bioinformatics to explore microbial ecology and evolution in all kinds of different systems. I'm currently a PhD student at University of Southern California, and will soon be moving on to NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffet Field, CA as a [Space Biology postdoctoral fellow](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-alfred-p-sloan-foundation-award-fellowships-to-study-space-station-microbes) where my primary focus will be hunting for molecular evolution in microbes from the International Space Station. I'm not entirely sure what this site will be all about yet. I'm kind of mixed between just random science-y blogs, or more along the lines of general bioinformatics tips and tutorials. Probably just end up being a mishmash of everything.

***If you want to waste some time on a story...***  
I've had quite the 'non-traditional' path into science and academia. I spent the better part of a decade after high school heavily involved in Muay Thai kickboxing, working as a mason, and trying to make it as a musician. While I certainly had a blast during this time, I really wasn't digging the long days of masonry during the hot NJ summers and cold NJ winters. And though I was happy to roll the dice and give music a shot, I was starting to accept that maybe I might not make it as a rock star ðŸ˜¢. So I made what at the time was a pretty tough decision, and I enrolled in a nearby [community college](https://www.ocean.edu/content/public.html) and started my undergrad at the age of 25. 

I've always loved science, and in particular have had a lifelong affinity for cosmology, astronomy, and astrobiology. But considering I was just starting out at a 2-year county college several years after most of my friends had finished their 4-year degrees and were currently establishing themselves as professionals of all sorts, my scholastic ambitions were pretty mild in this new beginning. I loosely thought I could get a degree in Biology and then go into pharmaceutical sales or something; I didn't really have a solid target, I just knew that no matter where things went I'd probably be better off than I was at the time. I did want to make up some time though, so as soon as I started school I began looking for internships almost immediately. And because of my lifelong affinity for all things space, and my propensity to go for the long shots, I started off looking at NASA. 

I didn't know it then, but this was really serendipitous timing as NASA had just launched a stellar website for finding and recruiting students. You can check it out [here](https://intern.nasa.gov/ossi/web/public/main/), and I encourage you to share it with anyone who might be interested. Through this site, students (at the high school, college, or grad-level) can search through and apply to posted opportunities across the dozen or so NASA facilities around the US. And by creating a profile in the system, they can also be found by NASA PIs looking for certain skills or interests for opportunities that may not be posted anywhere. 

This trememdous opportunity ended up working out for me. In my sophomore year, I landed an internship at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida working in a microbiology lab for a summer. And it is not an overstatement to say that that event drastically changed my trajectory. Before being there I had never even considered going to graduate school, I didn't even know anything about it. But being there with such incredible people doing such incredible things, I realized that maybe I still could do something... well, incredible. And it was because of my time at Kennedy that I was then called with an offer to go work in a microbial ecology lab for a semester at the Ames Research Center in northern California. And it was because of both of these NASA experiences that I applied to and was accepted into a PhD program at USC, where I came to investigate microbes at the bottom of the ocean. 

After a little over 4 years at USC, I find myself in an insanely different world than my former life's. I now consider myself to be a bioinformatician â€“ though it took me quite a while to get to a place where I actually feel comfortable thinking or saying that. I didn't even know 'bioinformatics' was a thing when this whole trip started. Now skills I've developed in just the past few years have enabled me to collaborate with groups working on amazing projects, and have paved my way back to NASA. And while I'm lightyears beyond where I was when I started, I still consider myself an infant compared to how much further I'd like to develop. But that's the thing. It's always relative. On this relative scale, if anyone is on an earlier stage than I currently am, I'd love to help out. 

So here I am. I love my job. It really is just a hobby I get paid to do.
