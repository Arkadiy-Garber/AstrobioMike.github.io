The basics to working at the command line along with some definitions and philosophy of starting out in bioinformatics can be found [here](https://astrobiomike.github.io/stamps2018/unix_intro){:target="_blank"}.

### Amplicon and Metagenomics overviews
[This page](/misc/amplicon_and_metagen){:target="_blank"} presents a broad-level overview of amplicon sequencing and metagenomics as approaches for microbial ecology, discussing some things each is useful and _not_ useful for, and then outlining some general workflows for each.

### Recovering genomes from metagenomes
[This tutorial](https://astrobiomike.github.io/metagenomics/metagen_anvio){:target="_blank"} goes through the co-assembly and recovering genomes from a relatively simple system using [Anvi'o](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/){:target="_blank"} to demonstrate some of the core concepts.
