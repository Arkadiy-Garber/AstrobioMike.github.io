# STAMPS 2018
The [STAMPS](https://stamps.mbl.edu/index.php/Main_Page) course (Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures) at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, USA.

### Introduction to Unix
The basics to working at the command line along with some definitions and philosophy of starting out in bioinformatics can be found [here](https://astrobiomike.github.io/stamps2018/unix_intro).

### Amplicon and Metagenomics overviews
[This page](/misc/amplicon_and_metagen) presents a broad-level overview of amplicon sequencing and metagenomics as approaches for microbial ecology, discussing some things each is useful and _not_ useful for, and then outlining some general workflows for each.

# DIBSI 2018
[DIBSI](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/) (Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute) has been a bioinformatics workshop run by Titus Brown for almost a decade. It now happens at UC Davis, USA each year. 

### Recovering genomes from metagenomes
[This tutorial](https://astrobiomike.github.io/metagenomics/metagen_anvio) goes through the co-assembly and recovering genomes from a relatively simple system using [Anvi'o](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/) to demonstrate some of the core concepts.
