**Amplicons and marker-genes and tags, oh my!**  
Most often a marker-gene analysis is the microbial ecologist’s first tool in a vast toolkit. It is primarily used as a broad survey of community structure. When first beginning to work with this type of data, it can be easy to get caught spinning your wheels about a sublte component in your processing pipeline that ultimately has a negligible impact compared to the noise we are working through. What I mean by this is, generally speaking, tag data is not the appropriate tool to answer really meticulous questions. It is a tool for comparing baseline *proxies* of metrics about microbial communities. It is a tool of exploration and hypothesis generation, not hypothesis confirmation.
