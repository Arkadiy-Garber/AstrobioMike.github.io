<h2>WARNING!</h2>
Don't get too lost in the weeds when working with marker-gene data. More often than not the kind of detailed questions that will land you in that situation can't be answered with this type of data anyway!</div>

**Amplicons and marker-genes and tags, oh my!**  
Most often a marker-gene analysis is the microbial ecologist's first tool in a vast toolkit. It is primarily used as a broad survey of community structure. As the warning notes above, when first beginning to work with this type of data it can be easy to get caught spinning your wheels about a subtle component in your processing pipeline that ultimately has a negligible impact compared to the noise we are working through. What I mean by this is, generally speaking, tag sequencing is not the appropriate tool to answer really meticulous questions. It is a tool for comparing baseline *proxies* of metrics about microbial communities. It is a tool of exploration and hypothesis generation, not hypothesis confirmation.  

There are a lot of things to keep in mind regarding what tag sequencing means, what it doesn't mean, what it can tell you, and what it can't. And people more immersed in the intricacies than I have written and published lots about this already. But at some point I'll give my two cents on all of these things in the [Caveat Central]({{ site.url}}/amplicon/caveats) post for those interested. For now, if you're new to this type of analysis, below you can find some common terminology defined as I understand things, and you can walkthrough a complete [example workflow]({{ site.url }}/amplicon/workflow_ex) for processing and analyzing a tag dataset.
