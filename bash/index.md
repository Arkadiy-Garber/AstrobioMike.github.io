Bash is the most common programming language in a Unix-like environment these days. More importantly, **bash is very likely the most foundational skillset you can learn for bioinformatics** (and much more). There is a [table of some quick terminology](/bash/bash_intro#some-terminology){:target="_blank"} for some help in what is meant by terms like "bash" and "Unix" on the [introduction to bash page](/bash/bash_intro#some-terminology){:target="_blank"}, which is definitely the place to start if you're completely new to this wonderful language. And if you would like some help getting a bash environment up and running on your computer, check out [this page](/bash/getting_bash_env) ðŸ™‚

# Why learn the command line?

*  it's the foundation for most of bioinformatics
*  enables use of non-GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools
*  can quickly perform operations on large files
*  reproducibility
*  automation of repetitive tasks
*  enables use of higher-powered computers elsewhere (server/cloud)
