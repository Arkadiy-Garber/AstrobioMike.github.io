*  enables use of non-GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools
*  quickly perform operations on large files
*  reproducibility
*  automation of repetitive tasks
	*  need to rename 1,000 files?

# Getting a bash environment
Before we get started, we need a terminal to work in. In the context of the loose definitions laid out above, a terminal is the common term for a Unix-like command-line environment. 

If you are working on a Mac or Linux computer, this is already taken care of for you and you can just do a spotlight search for "terminal". If you are working on a Windows computer, you will need to set up a working command-line environment.

* If your operating system is Windows 10 or later, the operating system includes a way to run a command-line environment. You can follow the helpful steps outlined [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/){:target="_blank"} to get set up.

* If you have an earlier Windows operating system, there are a few options. I've seen good results using [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/){:target="_blank"}, so if you're open to suggestions of what to try, I'd say start with that. To give that a shot you can follow these instructions (updating if there is a newer version available).  
  * Download the "Git-2.18.0-32-bit.exe" file from the Git for Windows [download page](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.18.0.windows.1){:target="_blank"}.  
  * After it is finished downloading, run the installer by opening the file and proceed through the installation:  
    * installing in the default folder location is fine
    * for "Which components should be installed?", make sure the following boxes are checked: "On the Desktop"; "Git Bash Here"; "Git GUI Here"; "Associate .git* configuration files with the default text editor"; and "Associate .sh files to be run with Bash"
    * the shortcuts default location is fine
    * change the default Git editor to "Nano"
    * on the "Adjusting your PATH environment" screen, select "Use Git from Git Bash only"
    * just click "Next" on the remaining configuration windows, and "Install" at the final one
  * When the installation is finished, you should be able to open a terminal window by launching Git Bash from your desktop. 

Now, head on over to [the intro to bash](/bash/basics){:target="_blank"} to get started!
