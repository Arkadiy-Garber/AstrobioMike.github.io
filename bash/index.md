Bash is the most common programming language in a Unix-like environment these days. There is a table of some quick terminology on the [introduction to bash page](/bash/basics){:target="_blank"}, which is definitely the place to start if you're completely new to this wonderful language. And if you would like some help getting a bash environment up and running on your computer, check out [this page](/bash/getting_bash_env) ðŸ™‚
