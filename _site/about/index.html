Hi there. My nameâ€™s Mike. I use the tools of bioinformatics to explore microbial ecology and evolution in all kinds of different systems. Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at University of Southern California, and will soon be moving on to NASAâ€™s Ames Research Center in Moffet Field, CA as a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-alfred-p-sloan-foundation-award-fellowships-to-study-space-station-microbes">Space Biology postdoctoral fellow</a> where my primary focus will be hunting for molecular evolution in microbes from the International Space Station. Iâ€™m not entirely sure what this site will be all about yet. Iâ€™m kind of mixed between just random science-y blogs, or more along the lines of general bioinformatics tips and tutorials. Probably just end up being a mishmash of everything.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong><em>If you want to waste some time on a storyâ€¦</em></strong><br />
Iâ€™ve had quite the â€˜non-traditionalâ€™ path into science and academia. I spent the better part of a decade after high school heavily involved in Muay Thai kickboxing, working as a mason, and trying to make it as a musician. While I certainly had a blast during this time, I really wasnâ€™t digging the long days of masonry during the hot NJ summers and cold NJ winters. And though I was happy to roll the dice and give music a shot, I was starting to accept that maybe I might not make it as a rock star ðŸ˜¢. So I made what at the time was a pretty tough decision, and I enrolled in a nearby <a href="https://www.ocean.edu/content/public.html">community college</a> and started my undergrad at the age of 25.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always loved science, and in particular have had a lifelong affinity for cosmology, astronomy, and astrobiology. But considering I was just starting out at a 2-year county college several years after most of my friends had finished their 4-year degrees and were currently establishing themselves as professionals of all sorts, my scholastic ambitions were pretty mild in this new beginning. I loosely thought I could get a degree in Biology and then go into pharmaceutical sales or something; I didnâ€™t really have a solid target, I just knew that no matter where things went Iâ€™d probably be better off than I was at the time. I did want to make up some time though, so as soon as I started school I began looking for internships almost immediately. And because of my lifelong affinity for all things space, and my propensity to go for the long shots, I started off looking at NASA.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t know it then, but this was really serendipitous timing as NASA had just launched a stellar website for finding and recruiting students. You can check it out <a href="https://intern.nasa.gov/ossi/web/public/main/">here</a>, and I encourage you to share it with anyone who might be interested. Through this site, students (at the high school, college, or grad-level) can search through and apply to posted opportunities across the dozen or so NASA facilities around the US. And by creating a profile in the system, they can also be found by NASA PIs looking for certain skills or interests for opportunities that may not be posted anywhere.</p>

<p>This trememdous opportunity ended up working out for me. In my sophomore year, I landed an internship at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida working in a microbiology lab for a summer. And it is not an overstatement to say that that event drastically changed my trajectory. Before being there I had never even considered going to graduate school, I didnâ€™t even know anything about it. But being there with such incredible people doing such incredible things, I realized that maybe I still could do somethingâ€¦ well, incredible. And it was because of my time at Kennedy that I was then called with an offer to go work in a microbial ecology lab for a semester at the Ames Research Center in northern California. And it was because of both of these NASA experiences that I applied to and was accepted into a PhD program at USC, where I came to investigate microbes at the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p>After a little over 4 years at USC, I find myself in an insanely different world than my former lifeâ€™s. I now consider myself to be a bioinformatician â€“ though it took me quite a while to get to a place where I actually feel comfortable thinking or saying that. I didnâ€™t even know â€˜bioinformaticsâ€™ was a thing when this whole trip started. Now skills Iâ€™ve developed in just the past few years have enabled me to collaborate with groups working on amazing projects, and have paved my way back to NASA. And while Iâ€™m lightyears beyond where I was when I started, I still consider myself an infant compared to how much further Iâ€™d like to develop. But thatâ€™s the thing. Itâ€™s always relative. On this relative scale, if anyone is on an earlier stage than I currently am, Iâ€™d love to help out.</p>

<p>So here I am. I love my job. It really is just a hobby I get paid to do.</p>
